Mr. Michael Dell is offering a monthly payment option on three of the latest models of PC.  He has

requested you to write a program that will allow the end user to enter the model type and the number of 

machines he/she would like to purchase of this same model type.  The possible model types and the 

associated monthly payback prices are shown in Figure 1.1

Model Type 		Monthly Pay-back Price (â‚¬) 

1              	62.50 

2             	55 

3             	35.75 

Figure 1.1

Your program should present a menu similar to that shown in Figure 1.2.  Once the user has specified 

the model type you must next request the number of units he/she would like to buy of this model type (cf. 

Figure 1.3).  For example is the user chose to buy machines of model type 2 you would request the 

number of machines he/she required for model type 2 (cf. Figure 1.3).

You may assume that the end user will enter a model type of 1, 2 or 3.  You may also assume that the 

end user will enter an integer value that is greater than 0 for the number of machines required.
